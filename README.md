## What is SideStore?

SideStore is a third-party iOS sideloading app that allows you to install IPA files (apps not available on the App Store). It is one of the most popular sideloading solutions in 2025 because it:

- Does not require jailbreak
- Works across iOS 15 through iOS 18.6+
- Uses a VPN-based refresh method (instead of relying on Wi-Fi or PC like AltStore)
- Supports a no-computer installation process
- Installs apps such as emulators, tweaks, utilities, and modded games

With full iOS 18 support, SideStore is the leading method for sideloading on non-jailbroken devices.
